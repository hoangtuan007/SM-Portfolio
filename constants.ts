  summary: `I'm a <b>Delivery Lead and technical-minded Project Manager</b> with a strong track record of owning and delivering complex technology initiatives in multi-team and scaled environments.
<br/><br/>
I specialize in <b>end-to-end delivery ownership</b> — managing scope, schedule, risk, quality, and stakeholder expectations — ensuring delivery is achieved <b>on time, on budget, and aligned with agreed outcomes</b>.
<br/><br/>
With a solid foundation in <b>Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and hybrid delivery models</b>, I apply a pragmatic approach to delivery, adapting ways of working to suit client needs, including traditional models when required.
<br/><br/>
My background as a software engineer and technical leader enables me to bridge <b>technology, delivery, and commercial considerations</b>. I work closely with engineers, architects, product owners, and client stakeholders to translate strategy into executable delivery plans and measurable results.
<br/><br/>
I am highly <b>client-facing and consultative</b>, experienced in delivery reporting, dependency and risk management, and facilitating informed trade-offs. I leverage <b>flow metrics, forecasting, and delivery analytics</b> to support decision-making, transparency, and predictability.
