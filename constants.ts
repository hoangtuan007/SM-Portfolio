  summary: `I'm a <b>technical-minded Project Manager and Agile Delivery Lead</b> with a strong track record of driving predictable delivery in complex, multi-team environments.
<br/><br/>
I specialize in <b>end-to-end delivery execution</b> — from planning and dependency management to risk mitigation and stakeholder alignment — while leveraging <b>Agile and hybrid delivery models</b> to adapt to real-world constraints.
<br/><br/>
My strength lies in bridging <b>technology, delivery, and business outcomes</b>. I work closely with engineers, architects, and product leaders to translate strategy into executable plans, stabilize delivery flow, and improve predictability. Rather than relying on intuition alone, I use <b>flow metrics and delivery analytics</b> to support decision-making and transparency.
<br/><br/>
I have hands-on experience building <b>Power BI dashboards and Azure DevOps Analytics</b> solutions to track throughput, cycle time, capacity, and commitments — enabling leadership teams to see risks early and make informed trade-offs.
<br/><br/>
