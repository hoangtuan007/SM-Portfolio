  title: "Technical Scrum Master",
  summary: `I am a <b>technical-minded Scrum Master and Agile Delivery professional</b> with strong experience leading development teams through <b>complex product delivery and scaled Agile environments</b>.
<br/><br/>
I bridge <b>project management discipline, Agile Scrum, and technical execution</b> — combining calm, servant leadership with <b>data-driven decision-making</b>. I use <b>flow metrics, Power BI dashboards, and delivery automation</b> to improve transparency, predictability, and team performance across portfolios.
<br/><br/>
I supported <b>Aperia’s Merchant initiative</b>, a large-scale outsourcing program for a US banking client transitioning away from Salesforce, starting from a <b>greenfield setup</b>. I helped establish the initial Agile operating model and later contributed to scaling delivery to <b>six Scrum teams within a SAFe environment</b>, aligning teams, stakeholders, and release execution.
<br/><br/>
In my current work with <b>VisionWeb</b>, I focus on:
<ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2 mb-2">
  <li>Stabilizing delivery flow and reducing delivery risk</li>
  <li>Improving cross-team alignment and dependency management</li>
  <li>Building <b>end-to-end delivery reporting</b> using Azure DevOps Analytics, Jira, DAX, and Power BI</li>
</ul>
I am particularly strong at <b>turning delivery data into actionable insights</b> for leadership — enabling better forecasting, clearer trade-offs, and continuous improvement grounded in evidence, not opinion.
